Hey everyone!
This is my first creative project as a frontend developer!
I used HTML,CSS,Javascript to create this to-do list website where we can enter tasks, edit them, mark them complete upon completion and clear all the tasks.

Files for the project:
All the image png files are inside a images folder.
The css stylesheet is inside the css folder.
The backend javascript file is inside the js folder.

I had fun making this and learnt a lot about css styling!
